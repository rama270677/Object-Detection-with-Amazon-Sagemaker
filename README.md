# Object-Detection-with-Amazon-Sagemaker


Prepare data for Sagemaker Object Detection.
Train a model using Sagemaker.
Deploy a trained model using Sagemaker.


In this project, you will learn how to train 
and deploy an object detector using Amazon 
Sagemaker. Sagemaker provides a number of 
machine learning algorithms ready to be used 
for solving a number of tasks. We will use the 
SSD Object Detection algorithm from Sagemaker 
to create, train and deploy a model that will 
be able to localize faces of dogs and cats from 
the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset.
